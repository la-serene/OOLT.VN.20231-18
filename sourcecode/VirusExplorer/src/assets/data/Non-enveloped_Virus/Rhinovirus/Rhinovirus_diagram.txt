Rhinoviruses are a diverse group of single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family, commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, notably the common cold. These non-enveloped viruses are characterized by their small size and stability, allowing them to thrive in the nasal passages and spread easily through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Symptoms of rhinovirus infection often include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, and cough, typically resolving within a week. Given the large number of rhinovirus strains and their ability to mutate, developing a universal vaccine has proven challenging, making symptom relief and prevention through hygiene measures the primary strategies for management.
