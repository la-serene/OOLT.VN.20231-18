Norovirus is a highly contagious, single-stranded RNA virus that is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Commonly associated with outbreaks in settings like cruise ships, hospitals, and schools, norovirus spreads primarily through the consumption of contaminated food or water, direct contact with infected individuals, or contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and stomach cramps, which can be severe but generally resolve within a few days. Due to its robustness and ease of transmission, strict hygiene measures and sanitation are essential for prevention and control.
