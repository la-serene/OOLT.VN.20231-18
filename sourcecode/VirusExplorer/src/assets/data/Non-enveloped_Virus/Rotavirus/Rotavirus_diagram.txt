Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus that is a leading cause of severe gastroenteritis, particularly in infants and young children worldwide. This non-enveloped virus is highly contagious and primarily spreads through the fecal-oral route, commonly via contaminated hands, objects, or food. Rotavirus infections are characterized by acute onset of symptoms such as severe diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed. Vaccination against rotavirus has been introduced in many countries as part of routine childhood immunization programs, significantly reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.
