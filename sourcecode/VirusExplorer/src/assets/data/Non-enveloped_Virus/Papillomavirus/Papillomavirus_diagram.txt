Papillomaviruses are a group of small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that primarily infect the epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) encompass over 200 different types, some of which are associated with various benign and malignant lesions, including warts and certain cancers. HPV transmission typically occurs through direct skin-to-skin contact, most commonly during sexual activity. Certain high-risk HPV types are linked to the development of cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers, while others can cause genital warts. Vaccination against specific HPV types has been developed as a preventive measure to reduce the incidence of associated cancers and other HPV-related diseases.
