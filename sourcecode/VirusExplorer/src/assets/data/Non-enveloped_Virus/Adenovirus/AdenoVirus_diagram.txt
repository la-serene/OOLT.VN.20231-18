Adenoviruses are a group of double-stranded DNA viruses known for causing a variety of illnesses in humans. They can lead to respiratory infections, such as the common cold, as well as more severe conditions like pneumonia, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. Adenoviruses are resistant to many common disinfectants and can survive for extended periods on surfaces, contributing to their ability to spread easily. Additionally, certain types of adenoviruses have been used in vaccine development due to their ability to stimulate strong immune responses.
