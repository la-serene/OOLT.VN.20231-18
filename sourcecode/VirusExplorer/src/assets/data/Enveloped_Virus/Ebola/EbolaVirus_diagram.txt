An illustrated diagram of the Ebola virus (EBOV), a virus responsible for severe haemorrhagic fever in humans and mammals, which can be transmitted through body fluids or natural reservoirs such as bats. The centre of the virus contains a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome and a nucleocapsid containing viral proteins VP35 and VP30. The matrix contains viral proteins VP40 and VP24, while the outer viral envelope uses glycoprotein (GP) spikes to attach to host cells. Once the virus enters a host cell, the viral RNA is translated to produce additional viral proteins. The viral proteins are enveloped using the host cell's plasma membrane and released through the process of budding, which destroys the cell.
