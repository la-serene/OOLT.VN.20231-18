The influenza virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that primarily targets the respiratory tract, categorized into types A, B, and C, with type A further distinguished by hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. It spreads via respiratory droplets and exhibits seasonal peaks, causing symptoms like fever, cough, and fatigue. Prevention and treatment include annual vaccinations and antiviral medications targeting specific viral proteins.
